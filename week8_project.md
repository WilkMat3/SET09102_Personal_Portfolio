# Project work 1
## Summary
This week I have been working on the [Access lists of pool experts so that I can recruit them into the team]" issue. The work was split between two people, I would be taking care of CRUD methods and tests and my colleague would take care of UI and views. 
As a part of the acceptance criteria we had to make sure that the implementation allows for viewing a pool of experts along with their associations status, status change date and working location.

## Review changes to my code


## My review 

## Reflections

In week 8, you are exercising all the principles and techniques that have been discussed 
in the module so far. Your portfolio entry should demonstrate your ability to integrate 
the various dimensions of software engineering into your practice. It should include 

* A descriptive summary of the issue that you worked on.
* Snippets from your code with commentary showing how you have used good software design 
  practice.
* A descriptive summary of the test code that you have written.
* A reflective summary of any changes that were requested during the code review along 
  with your fixes.
* A descriptive summary of any issues you found with the code that you were asked to review.
* A general reflective section that identifies, for example,
  * New things you have realised this week
  * Common problems that can arise in a team development situation
  * How your practice compares to other people's
  * etc.

Be sure to include links to the original items in the team's GitHub repository.

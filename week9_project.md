# Project work week 9
## Summary
This week I have been building on the work from week 3 by working on the [Maintain view lists of partner agencies (UN, International, national, NGO, voluntary) so that I can recruit them into the team](https://github.com/xinjoonha/SET09102_PURPLE/issues/64). I have added a page that allows for viewing and filtering Organisations by name or associations status. This ticket also required  extending the organisation model by adding association status.

### Other Work

## Testing

## Getting my code reviewed
## Leading a code review
## Reflections

### Teamwork
I can see improvement in the overall team cooperation. We raise problems on our discord channel and help each other. This week I have done some troubleshooting with other teammates. Retrospectively, I think that what helped was taking more ownership of the project. Week before I have created a repository pattern and also organised discussion about UI consistency. I provided informal leadership and support to my colleagues which made the team more organised. Other people also started coming up with ideas such as keeping consistent UI and using the form from week 4 as a reference for reviews.  As a result we are more effective as a team but there is still room for improvement.

### Challanges & learnings
We had some issues with test solution, many people required help with troubleshooting. I have been providing help as I was succesful in creating NUnit test solution in week 3. I think I should have been more vocal about what is required to create a testing solution. I should have provided a guide on how to do it as well to avoid wasting time. 

Other problem that we encoutered this week was regarding testing solution not being tracked by github. I was surprised that I have not noticed this before. This problem exists because the project initialy was not created with testing solution in the main branch. To amend that I created a pull request for just for testing solution I configured that correctly making sure that all references and dependencies are included.
This is something that as a group we should have done in the begining. We wasted a lot of time by configuring test project and nobody ever noticed that the soultion was not tracked.

## References
In week 9, you are continuing with the team project. Your portfolio entry should 
demonstrate how your software engineering practice is improving. It should include
much the same content as last week's:

* A descriptive summary of the issue that you worked on.
* Snippets from your code with commentary showing how you have used good software design 
  practice.
* A descriptive summary of the test code that you have written.
* A reflective summary of any changes that were requested during the code review along 
  with your fixes.
* A descriptive summary of any issues you found with the code that you were asked to review.
* A general reflective section that identifies, for example,
  * New things you have realised this week
  * Common problems that can arise in a team development situation
  * How your practice compares to other people's
  * etc.

Be sure to include links to the original items in the team's GitHub repository.

In the reflective sections, try to identify things that you have done better this week. 
This could include, for example,

* Better application of the principles of clean code.
* Avoiding the repetition of previous mistakes.
* More comprehensive test coverage.
* Adoption of a more systematic personal workflow.
* Improved identification of problems in other people's code.
* etc.
